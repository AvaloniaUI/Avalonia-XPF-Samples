## About
Avalonia XPF is the commercial solution that enables WPF applications to run natively on macOS, Linux, iOS, Android and the Web with minimal code changes. This repository contains sample applications demonstrating how to use Avalonia XPF to extend your WPF applications to additional platforms.

Key features demonstrated in these samples include:

* Running WPF applications on macOS and Linux with little to no code modification
* Platform-specific considerations and best practices
* Integration patterns for common WPF frameworks and libraries
* Migration strategies and compatibility solutions

Avalonia XPF is a commercial product licensed per-app. For more information about licensing and to get started with Avalonia XPF, visit the [Avalonia XPF web page](https://avaloniaui.net/xpf).

## Setting up your environment 

* The samples all use a [centralized management](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/xpf/advanced/centralized-management) of the license key, meaning you can set your license key just once! 
* You will need to have an active trial of Avalonia XPF for these samples to work. 

## Hybrid XPF 
Mix-and-match WPF and Avalonia in a single project. 

This sample demonstrates how you can add WPF controls to your existing Avalonia application. Read the [docs](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/xpf/embedding/xpf-in-avalonia).
